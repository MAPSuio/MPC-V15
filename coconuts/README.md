Suppose three sailors are stranded on an island. They spend the first
day on the island collecting cocounts, agreeing to divide the coconuts
the day after. Afraid of missing out, one by one they wake up in the
night and take <em>half</em> of the remaining coconuts and give
<em>half a coconut</em> to a bystanding monkey.
After the last sailor claimed his share, there was only one
coconut left, which was given to the monkey.

<em>How many coconuts were there in the original pile?</em>
