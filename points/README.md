The file [points.txt] represents 1000 points in the plane. Each point is
described on a single line by its x-coordinate and y-coordinate (see the file).

What two points lie the furthest apart (in euclidean distance)?

The answer should be formatted as `a b c d`, where (a, b) comes before
(c, d) in the file.

Example:
If the points (124, 533) and (925, 436) happened to be the two points that are
the furthest away from each other, the answer would be `124 533 925 436`, since
(124, 533) comes before (925, 436) in the list.

Answer: 997 19 14 994
