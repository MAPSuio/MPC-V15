A palindrome is a number that is the same "forwards and backwards". For instance,
12321 and 1331 are palindromes. More precisely, a number is palindromic if
the *i*-th first digit is the same as the *i*-th last digit.

We are interested in the smallest three-digit palindrome that can be written as
the sum of three *unique* three-digit palindromes.

Answer: 333
