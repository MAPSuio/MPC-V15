Palindrome trifecta
A palindrome is a number that is the same "forwards and backwards". In other
words a number is palindromic if the i-th first digit is the same as the i-th
last digit. For instance, 12321 and 1331 are palindromes.

We are interested in the smallest three-digit palindrome that can be written as
the sum of three unique three-digit palindromes.
