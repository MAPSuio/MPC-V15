We are looking for an integer whose bit-representation appended to the bit
representation of 43046721 is the bit representation of 2888816585588551.

Can you help us out here?

Example: 5 which is '101' in base 2) appended to 3 (which is '11' in base 2) is 29,
	 so the number we need to append to the bit representation of 3 to get 29 is 5.
	 
Solution: Note that the length of the bit-representation is bl(x) = 1+floor(log2(x)).
	  Then sol(m,n) = bitwise-xor(bit-shift-left(n,bl(m)-bl(n)),m).
	  So the solution is x=40353607.

Answer: 40353607
