Given the two integers n = 43046721 and m = 2888816585588551, return the integer x which bit-representation appended to the bit-representation
of n gives the bit-representation of the number m.

Example: If n=3 (which is '11' in base 2) and m=29
	 (which is '11101' in base 2), then the result is 5 (which is '101' in base 2.) 

Solution: Note that the length of the bit-representation is bl(x) = 1+floor(log2(x)).
	  Then sol(m,n) = bitwise-xor(bit-shift-left(n,bl(m)-bl(n)),m).
	  So the solution is x=40353607.
