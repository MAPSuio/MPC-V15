![Geeks and Nerds](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/geeks_and_nerds.png)

[this file](data.txt) contains a list of name and interest-pais, indicating
that a person likes a certain thing. For example, the first line says that
<code>Aiden</code> likes <code>DTrace</code>. Naturally, a person can have
multiple interests and this is reflected in the dataset.
<em>The dataset is not sorted.</em>.

<code>Dungeons & Dragons</code>, <code>Magic The Gathering</code>,
<code>Star Wars</code>, <code>Pok√©mon</code> and <code>Comics</code>
are considered <em>geeky</em> interests. Any person who likes any of these
interests is a geek. Similarly, <code>Category Theory</code>,
<code>DTrace</code>, <code>Chess</code>, <code>Linear Algebra</code>,
<code>Quantum Mechanics</code> and <code>Neuroscience</code> are considered
<em>nerdy</em> interests. Any person who like any of those things is a nerd.

How many individuals in the dataset are both a geek and a nerd?

Solution: 69
