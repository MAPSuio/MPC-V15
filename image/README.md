The image [spring.png] is the poster for the MAPS Spring Challenge as shown on
the IFI info screens. The background is a nice shade of green, namely RGB
\#5B9836. Somewhere hidden in this image is the portrait of a famous
celebrity, painted in a _slightly_ different shade of green, namely RGB
\#5A9836.

We want to know the nickname (which typically is used as his/her first name),
in lower case, of this celebrity.

### Solution
This can be solved in several ways. The easiest is to use Matlab (which has a
nice image library) or Python and find the pixels that have the color \#5A9836.
For instance set these pixels to black and all other pixels to white and
display the result.

This is also possible to do with Photoshop or similar tools.
