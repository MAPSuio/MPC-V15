The image [spring.png] is the poster for the MAPS Spring Challenge as shown on
the IFI info screens. The background is a nice shade of green, namely RGB
#5B9836. Somewhere hidden in this image is the portrait of a famous
celebrity, painted in a _slightly_ different shade of green, namely RGB
#5A9836.

We want to know the nickname (which typically is used as his/her first name),
in lower case, of this celebrity.
