We are now interested in some special 4x4 matrices that have the following
properties:

1. All elements are integers from 1 through 7 (inclusive)
2. The sum of each row and each column must all be the same
3. The sum of all elements in the entire matrix is twice the sum of the two
   diagonals

How many distinct 4x4 matrices have all these three properties?

Answer: 3789991
