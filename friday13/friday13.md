We are now interested in friday the 13th, especially consecutive months with
friday the 13th.

For instance this year, we had friday the 13th both in Febuary and March, which
are consecutive months. When is the next time (from today) consecutive friday
the 13th will occur?

The answer should specify both of the consecutive months by year and month
number. For instance, for Feb and March 2015; `2015-02 2015-03`
