Consider a classroom full of students.

Assume that:

* The students are born within the same year,
* a year consists of 365 days,
* the probability of being born on a given day is uniformly distributed across the year and
* the probability of being born on a given minute of a day is uniformly distributed across the day.

<em>How many students must be in the classroom for there to be at least a 50% probability that two of the students are born within the same minute?</em> By within the same minute, we mean the same clock-minute, ie. a minute starting at YYYY.MM.DD hh:mm:00.
